# Pointless projects

The things that will go here have little reason to exist.
Typically they were prompted by some idiosyncratic curiosity, or
to test something out or to illustrate a point.

These are made public probably because I wanted to use something
in them as an illustration of something or other, and a Gist wouldn't
do.
